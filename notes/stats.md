# available data
I think that all of the data stored on their servers is just stored in sets. A set stores the games played and the players involved. A game stores...
- players
- characters
- score
- map
- date & time

# derived data
We can also take almost any of these and track them over time.
## matchup winrate
(Games won as character X vs character Y) / (Games as character X vs Character Y)
## stage winrate
(Games won on map X) / (Games on map X)
## matchup stage winrate
